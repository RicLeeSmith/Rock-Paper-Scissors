# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Design a Java Rock, Paper, and Scissors Game as follows: 
It has 3 options: 
1. Play one game 
2. Play five games 
3. Play an infinite number of games 

When the game is finished you need to: 
1. Change the winners face from a normal face to a smiley face. 
2. Change the loserâ€™s face from normal face to a sad face. 
You are welcome to use your images. 
When you move your mouse into the smiley face area, it will play a happy sound. 
Sad sound will be played when you move your mouse into the sad face area. 

When Infinite Games is selected and completed, a text field will display how many times you played in total. 

Other options are flexible. 
Design it your way.
